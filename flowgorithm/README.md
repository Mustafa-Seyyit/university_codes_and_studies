# Flowgorithm Projects

This folder contains basic algorithm exercises I created at university using Flowgorithm.

Each subfolder includes:
- `.fprg` file: Flowgorithm project file  
- `.pdf` file: Flowchart diagram output

## Examples
- `numbers-1-to-100/` → Algorithm that prints numbers from 1 to 100  
- `factorial-calc/` → Algorithm that calculates the factorial of a number
